  'How to use context-db, a markdown knowledge base containing all project
  context, standards, and knowledge.'

## What context-db is

`context-db/` is a hierarchical Markdown knowledge base that lives in the
project repo. It contains everything you need to understand this project —
architecture, conventions, standards, domain context, design decisions, user
preferences. Think of it as the project's long-term memory.

Every `.md` file has YAML frontmatter with a `description` field. A script reads
those descriptions and generates a table of contents for any folder. You browse
the TOC, read only what's relevant, and move on.

## Why this matters

You are starting a conversation with no prior context. The knowledge base exists
so you don't have to rediscover what the team already knows. Reading it first
means you write code that fits the project's patterns, follow the right
conventions, and avoid repeating past mistakes.

Skip it and you'll waste tokens guessing at things that are already documented.

## Context-db entries about code

Context-db is a starting point, not a substitute for reading the code. It gets
you to the right part of the codebase and tells you things you can't learn from
the code alone (why decisions were made, patterns that span multiple files,
surprises that would bite you). Always read the actual code before implementing
changes.

When writing about code, include enough to get a reader or agent to the right
place without grepping — file paths, function names, and for large files, a
section map (`filename:lineno — description`). If the information is already
clear from reading the code, don't repeat it here.

## How to read it

Run the TOC script on the root folder:

```
.claude/skills/context-db-manual/scripts/context-db-generate-toc.sh context-db/
```

The output lists every subfolder and file with a one-line description. Subfolder
paths end with `/` — run the script on them to go deeper. Only open files whose
descriptions are relevant to your task.

**Do this at the start of every conversation.** Read topics relevant to the
user's request before writing code or making suggestions.

## How to write to it

Every `.md` file requires frontmatter:

```yaml
---
description: One-line summary shown in the TOC
---
```

Optional: `status: draft | stable | deprecated` (default: `stable`).

Two file types:

- **Documents** — frontmatter + body content.
- **Folder descriptions** (`<folder-name>.md`) — frontmatter only, no body.
  Registers the folder in the parent TOC.

Descriptions must be accurate, complete summaries — not titles. A reader or agent must be
able to judge relevance without opening the file.

### Where to put new content

The `<project-name>-project/` folder is for knowledge **specific to this
project** — architecture, data models, domain context, design decisions. When
writing about this project, put it here (or in a subfolder of it).

Folders parallel to `<project-name>-project/` (like `coding-standards/`,
`writing-standards/`) contain **project-agnostic** knowledge — standards and
conventions that apply across many projects. These are often symlinked from a
shared standards repo. You will rarely need to create or edit these folders. If
you do, only put content there that applies universally, not content specific to
the project you're working in.

## How to maintain it

**5–10 items per folder.** When a folder exceeds this, split into subfolders.
The tree is a decision tree — each level should halve the search space.

**Keep descriptions current.** After any change, rewrite every affected
`description` to match current content.

**Post-session checklist:**

1. Capture — create or update documents with new knowledge.
2. Summarize — rewrite affected descriptions.
3. Reorganize — split or merge folders to stay at 5–10 items.
4. Verify — run `context-db-generate-toc.sh` on affected folders.
